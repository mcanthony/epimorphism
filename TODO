  fix seg fault on exit - glTexSubImage2D in renderer - copying from pbo(HOW?)
  pyopengl bug
  replace pyopencl with pycl
    main engine
    asynchronous keyboard commands
    post processing
    better debug build program fail messages    
    sporadic crash on compile
    understand ctypes/OpenCL/GIL/clCreateProgram issue
    uploading images - problem & memory leak
    fix automating components
    make kernel splices all use procompiler & #define?
    state.par now a dictionary
  added cmds dir
  record script
  dict obj data blacklist
  option to randomize seed
  clean cmdcenter
  rescale time
  cleaned paths
  load state
  pngs are corrupted
  make osc use paths
  time 0-3
  prepare app for launch
  remove freeglut dependencies
  windows build
    optional PIL dependency
  fix console


PRICELESS:
  more tiles
	more coloring schemes
	better T
	variable # of seeds

	better main program
	
	investigate texturing of seed_w

	maybe limit certain image types to certain seed_w
	
	interpolation discontinuities
	

RELEASE QUEUE:

	make it so you can save & load paths directly

  in generator, fix default state application name

  TouchOSC template 

  only one internal[] necessary

  mac build
    
  OpenCL ATI Stream??

  new application deploy script

  detect if device available 
  scale performance to system

  contents

  keyboard bindings
  final testing & documentation

  website & videos



LATER:
  constraints on incremental par[] variables

  animation with touchosc

  move color axis to cpu


  ping osc device - disable if not found

  implement pfn_notify in compiler necessar???
  gpu freezes when compiling?
  do second stage compilation in componentmanager after first finished

  make programs dict objs?

  merge scripts into 1 program

  reorganize module(cmdcenter, engine, interface) initialization

  fix MIDI

  synchronize available pars to comonents
  clean glbals
  think more about dict objs & structs file

  OpenCL CPUs - replace images with buffers

  periodically connect to server ??
  more sophisticated application loading - switch apps on the fly
  figure out why app takes forever to exit - GLUT
  Try texture instead of PBO??? 

  investing gamma correction artifacts?

  Video:
    optimize mencoder command
    make another video

  Archiving

  plot fps

  cull mode - hsls & FRACT?
  reset_hsls

  finish states:
    paths
    scripts
    programs
    variables

    add image to state

    make sure they save correctly
    make sure they load correctly - startup & intermediate

  stop paths dicts & programs in load

  make component switching a program??


Documentation: 
  readme, etc
  add argument lists to help


Archiving - 
  archive feature for adding to archive or deleting
  auto migrate feature


Contents:
  programs
  paths
  color functions
  seed functions
  transformations - state machine?
  seed transformations
  animations
  w=-1 response
  kernel optimization  
  scripts


Ideas -
  figure out command recording
  make components object
  move interface to another thread  
  metapaths 
  opengl effects
  better keyboard multipliers
  when loading state, upload image too?
  integrate ipython into console
  quantize angles?
  different reductions?
  camera input
  seed impulses
  deal with state dumps that occur while blending
  force fps
  multiple gpu integration
  Luv or Lab color space?


Misc Tasks - 
  color speeds & phases
  ??configmanager dump object newline issues(only really relevant for scripts & paths)
